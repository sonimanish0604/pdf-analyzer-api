**Product Document — PDF Analyzer API**
**1. Problem Statement**

Malicious PDF files remain one of the most common attack vectors for phishing, ransomware, and data exfiltration. Traditional antivirus tools often miss embedded scripts or spoofed file types.
Organizations and developers need a simple, API-driven way to automatically scan PDFs before accepting, storing, or forwarding them.

**2. Target Users**

Developers / SaaS teams → who need to validate user-uploaded documents.

Security & Compliance teams → who must reduce risks from file-based malware.

SMBs and Enterprises → who want a lightweight, affordable security API without heavy infrastructure.

**3. Product Vision**

The PDF Analyzer API is a cloud-native, developer-friendly service that automatically detects risky content in PDFs — helping companies protect their systems and end users, while being easy to integrate, scalable, and monetizable.

**4. Key Features (v1.0)**

🔐 Detect encryption / password-protected PDFs.

📎 Identify embedded JavaScript (common in malware).

📁 Detect embedded files (e.g., hidden ZIP/DOCX).

🕵️ Flag spoofed file types (e.g., disguised as .pdf).

🌐 Check URLs inside PDFs with DNS resolution + VirusTotal integration.

⚡ Pure in-memory scanning (safe for PII; no disk writes).

**5. Roadmap**

Near-Term (v1.x)

Improve scan accuracy with more PDF parsing edge cases.

Admin dashboard for API key management + usage stats.

Basic quota & billing integration (RapidAPI / Stripe).

Mid-Term (v2.x)

Support user input for password-protected PDFs.

Generate signed JSON or PDF scan reports.

Multi-tenant plans (Free / Pro / Enterprise).

Long-Term (v3.x)

File hash checking against public malware feeds.

Integration with SOC/SIEM tools (Splunk, ELK).

SLA-backed enterprise offering (uptime guarantees).

**6. Monetization Strategy**

Free Tier: Limited scans per month; rate-limited API key.

Pro Tier: Pay-per-use or subscription with higher limits.

Enterprise Tier: Custom plans with SLA, reporting, and premium support.

Distribution channels: RapidAPI Marketplace, direct Stripe billing, cloud marketplace listings.

**7. Success Metrics**

Technical: <500ms average scan latency, 99.9% uptime, <1% false negatives.

Business: First 100 API keys issued, MRR from subscriptions, customer retention.

Adoption: # of integrations into SaaS apps or workflows.

**8. Differentiation**

Unlike heavy endpoint AV tools, the PDF Analyzer API is:

Lightweight (API-first, fast JSON responses).

Privacy-conscious (in-memory only, optional VirusTotal).

Affordable (pay for usage, no enterprise licensing fees).
